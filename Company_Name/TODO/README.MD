# Todo

## Cloud
The current setup utilizes a .json file called database to act as a source for all the application meta, like install commands and locations, I would like this to come from SupaBase or Similar instead.

## Secrets Management
When moving to a cloud resource, that will require management of secrets/API keys to securely authenticate to the API server. This can be done with local envrionement variables or secrets management tools like Hashicorp Vault or Bitwarden Secrets.

## Documentation
Always more documentation to write

## Mapping
Make a logical map of the project and its current and future connections. 

## Help
Should add a [string] to main.ps1 to accept help as an option to explain how to use the tool.

## Validation
Add a script to run back through the manifest and check the workstation for any missing applications or configurations.

Add a script to check the JSON for Accuracy.
