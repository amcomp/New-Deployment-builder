# Windows Workstation Deployment Tool
 
 ## Project Description

This is a lightweight deployment utility designed to streamline Windows workstation setup. It performs three primary functions:

- Manifest Generation – Extracts installed applications from a Windows workstation to generate a reusable manifest.

- App Deployment – Uses the manifest to quickly install selected applications on new or existing workstations.

- Basic Configuration – Handles initial endpoint setup tasks such as domain joining and setting system time.

## Goals
### Learning First
- My main objective is to deepen my knowledge of scripting, DevOps principles, and cloud integration by building a tool I would actually use.

### Real-World Utility
- I want to improve my understanding of Windows workstation deployment, configuration, and automation in real-world IT environments.
